# Diplomski_backend
This Node.js backend serves as the foundation for a messaging application empowered by the OpenMLS protocol. OpenMLS, a robust protocol, introduces end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy to communication channels, ensuring that exchanged messages remain confidential and immune to tampering, even in the face of network vulnerabilities.
The Power of OpenMLS Integration

By seamlessly integrating OpenMLS into this backend, we're introducing a new paradigm of security to messaging applications. The protocol not only fortifies communication channels but also establishes a trust framework, offering users peace of mind knowing their conversations are protected from prying eyes.
Key Features

    Security First: OpenMLS prioritizes security by implementing state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms, safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of every message exchanged.

    Seamless Integration: Our backend seamlessly integrates the OpenMLS protocol, providing developers with an easy-to-use platform for building secure messaging applications.

    Enhanced Privacy: With OpenMLS, users can communicate freely without worrying about privacy breaches or unauthorized access to their conversations.

Prerequisite: OpenMLS Protocol

It's important to note that this project requires the built OpenMLS protocol for proper functionality. When building OpenMLS, developers only need to copy the built target to this directory. Ensure that the OpenMLS protocol is built and accessible before running this backend. You can find the OpenMLS repository and build instructions at openmls/openmls.
Getting Started

To start leveraging the power of secure messaging with OpenMLS, simply clone this repository, follow the setup instructions, and integrate the backend with your frontend application. With just a few steps, you'll be on your way to offering users a secure and private messaging experience.
